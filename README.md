## Reflections

* Lab 01 - I struggled a bit getting my GitHub repo to merge with my local copy. I ended up getting flustered and needed to reclone my repo down. I was finally able to get the Lab done and hopefully I will be able to fix errors like this in the future, so I can stay on task better. I will do Lab 2 at work tomorrow.
